# Accountability checker
This is a small project based on a larger app idea I would like to build someday. 
I went looking for a tool that would present me with a pre-set list of checkpoints
every day to determine if I could call it a good or bad day for productivity and 
accountability. I didn't find anything like that and I didn't want to create a 
workaround using any of my normal productivity apps, like Wunderlist, because I wanted 
the interface of my chosen solution to be distinct and bare-bones. The point  of this
daily checklist would be to reflect on the day and to get a feeling of clarity.

Concept:
1. User chooses their personal general growth areas
2. From specific growth areas, User chooses specific generic daily standards or writes their own.
3. User recieves daily standards and global to-dos checklist. 

Features:
- Simple daily check-off list
- Notification at set time each day to do the check-offs
- simple charts generated after n days to show progress
- unmet checkmarks after x days get suggestions for improvement when user opens app
- ability to use social media to share progress

Example growth areas:
Integrity
Productivity
Mindfulness
Achievement 
Emotional honesty

Example specific standards:
“I set and implemented a plan for the day which honestly estimated my abilities."
“I stayed accountable to agreements made with myself."
“I stayed kind to myself."
“My day’s work fit into the long-term goals I have for myself."
