# Accountability checker
This is a small project based on a larger app idea I would like to build someday. 
I went looking for a tool that would present me with a pre-set list of checkpoints
every day to determine if I could call it a good or bad day for productivity and 
accountability. I didn't find anything like that and I didn't want to create a 
workaround using any of my normal productivity apps, like Wunderlist, because I wanted 
the interface of my chosen solution to be distinct and bare-bones. The point  of this
daily checklist would be to reflect on the day and to get a feeling of clarity.

<b>Concept:</b><br />
1. User chooses their personal general growth areas <br />
2. From specific growth areas, User chooses specific generic daily standards or writes their own.<br />
3. User recieves daily standards and global to-dos checklist.<br />

<b>Features:</b><br />
Simple daily check-off list<br />
Notification at set time each day to do the check-offs<br />
Simple charts generated after n days to show progress<br />
Unmet checkmarks after x days get suggestions for improvement when user opens app<br />
Ability to use social media to share progress<br />

<b>Example growth areas:</b><br />
Integrity<br />
Productivity<br />
Mindfulness<br />
Achievement <br />
Emotional honesty<br />

<b>Example specific standards:</b><br />
“I set and implemented a plan for the day which honestly estimated my abilities."<br />
“I stayed accountable to agreements made with myself."<br />
“I stayed kind to myself."<br />
“My day’s work fit into the long-term goals I have for myself."<br />
