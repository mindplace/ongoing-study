# Accountability checker
This is a small project based on a larger app idea I would like to build someday. 
I went looking for a tool that would present me with a preset list of checkpoints
every day to determine if I could call it a good or bad day for productivity and 
accountability. I didn't find anything like that and I didn't want to create a 
workaround using any of my normal productivity apps, like Wunderlist, because I wanted 
the interface of my chosen solution to be distinct and bare-bones. The point of this
daily checklist would be to reflect on the day and to get a feeling of clarity. And
an important feature would be the ability to then use the everyday data to create 
tables and track progress, both overall and with specific elements of the checklist.

<b>Concept:</b><br />
1. User chooses their personal general growth areas. <br />
2. From specific growth areas, user chooses generic daily standards or writes their own.<br />
3. User recieves daily standards and global to-dos checklist to complete.<br />
4. Tool gets more useful over time as it aggregates data for the user. 

<b>Features:</b><br />
Simple daily check-off list<br />
Notification at set time each day to do the check-offs<br />
Simple charts generated after n days to show progress<br />
Unmet checkmarks after x days get suggestions for improvement when user opens app<br />
Ability to use social media to share progress<br />

<b>Example big-picture areas for growth:</b><br />
Integrity<br />
Productivity<br />
Mindfulness<br />
Achievement <br />
Emotional honesty<br />

<b>Example specific standards:</b><br />
"I set and implemented a plan for the day which honestly estimated my abilities."<br />
"I stayed accountable to agreements made with myself."<br />
"I stayed kind to myself."<br />
"I spent 15 minutes meditating."<br />
"My dayâ€™s work fit into the long-term goals I have for myself."<br />
