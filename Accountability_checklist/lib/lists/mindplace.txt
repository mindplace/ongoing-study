I set a plan for the day which was actionable and didn't overreach.
I worked on things with long-term benefit.
I did what I decided to do today.
I did what I promised others I would do today.
I worked on code.
Total distraction time was under 1 hour.
I took care of my boys.
I took care of my body.
I stayed aware and kind to myself.
