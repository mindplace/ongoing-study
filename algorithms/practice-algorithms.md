## Easy

#### Smallest in series
Given a `string` representing a sentence, split the sentence and return shortest `string` without using built-in `methods/functions`.

Given an `array`, return the smallest `string`.

#### Most common letter
Given a `string`, return the character that is most common, including the number of times it occurs.

#### Normalize an integer
Given an `integer`, return the `integer` represented as a `string` with commas in the correct positions.

#### Check for the 10
Write a `method/function` that takes an `array` of `numbers` and returns a `boolean` based on if any `number` in the `array`, added up to its `index`, equals 10.

#### Factorize
Write a `method/function` that takes an `integer` and returns an `array` of `integers` representing the original `integer's` factors. E.g., given `10`, return `[1, 2, 5, 10]`.

#### Intersections in Arrays
Given two `arrays` of `integers`, determine if both `arrays` contain the same elements, i.e. `[1,2,3,4,5]` and `[5,4,3,2,1]`.

#### All Unique

Write a `function/method` that takes a `string` and returns a `boolean` based on whether all characters in the `string` are unique.

Write a `function/method` that takes an `array` and returns a `boolean` based on whether all items in the `array` are unique.

Write a `function/method` that takes a `hash` and returns a `boolean` based on whether all `key/value` pairs in the `hash` are unique.

#### Factorial

Write a `function/method` that takes a number `n` and returns the factorial.

#### Queue
Implement a `queue` data structure that includes functionality like `shift`, `push`, and `empty?`.

#### Stack
Implement a `stack` data structure that includes functionality like `pop`, `push`, and `empty?`.

#### Palindrome
Given a `string` input, determine if the `string` is a palindrome (spelled the same backwards as forwards, ex. racecar). Do not use any built-in `methods/functions`.

## Medium

#### Project Euler
[Problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [solutions](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).

#### Implement sorting algorithms
Check some out [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).

#### Fibonacci
Write a `method/function` that takes a number `n` and produces an `array` of Fibonacci numbers, where the length of the `array` is `n`.

#### Pig Latin
Write a `method/function` that takes a `string` and returns the Pig Latin version of that string (including single-word `strings`, multi-word `strings`, correctly handling edge cases like `queen` or `quirk`, and correctly returning `strings` with punctuation).

#### Linked List
Implement a `linked-list` data structure that includes functionality like checking for length, finding a specific node by linear search, adding nodes, and deleting nodes.

#### Prime factorization
Write a `method/function` that takes a number and returns the prime factors that make it up. Given `123123123`, should return `[3, 3, 41, 333667]`; given `8`, should return `[2, 2, 2]`; given `6`, should return `[2, 3]`

#### Products of Ints Except At Index
You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index. E.g., given `[1, 7, 3, 4]`, return `[84, 12, 28, 21]`

#### Sum triangle numbers
Given a number n, sum up all the right-most numbers from the triangle.

Example: n = 4

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10

=> 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20
```

## Hard

#### Binary search
Write a `method/function` that takes an `array` and a search item, and returns the `index` of the item if found in the `array`, or `nil` otherwise.

#### Binary conversion
Write a `method/function` that takes an `integer` and returns it in binary notation.

#### Snake case search
Write a `method/function` that takes an `array` of `arrays` to represent a board, each of which contain a series of letters; along with a `string` representing a search term. And returns a `boolean` based on whether the word is present on the board. Example, given 'hello' and below board, should return `true`:

```
[
[a, r, f, d, g, g, h],
[w, r, f, t, q, e, x],
[s, c, v, f, g, l, l],
[r, f, g, q, t, x, o]
]
```

#### My_Shuffle
Write a `method/function` that takes an `array` and randomizes the items inside it, without relying on any existing built-in `functions/methods`.
