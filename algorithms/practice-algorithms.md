# Algorithms!

Smaller to larger numbers go from easiest to hardest.

<hr>

1. Smallest in series
  * Given a string representing a sentence, split the sentence and return shortest string without using built-in methods/functions.

    Given an array, return the smallest string.

2. Most common letter
  * Given a string, return the character that is most common, including the number of times it occurs.

3. Normalize an integer
  * Given an integer, return the integer represented as a string with commas in the correct positions.

4. Check for the 10
  * Write a method/function that takes an array of numbers and returns a boolean based on if any number in the array, added up to its index, equals 10.

5. Factorize
  * Write a method/function that takes an integer and returns an array of integers representing the original integers factors. E.g., given 10, return [1, 2, 5, 10].

6. Intersections in Arrays
  * Given two arrays of integers, determine if both arrays contain the same elements, i.e. [1,2,3,4,5] and [5,4,3,2,1].

7. All Unique

  * Write a function/method that takes a string and returns a boolean based on whether all characters in the string are unique.

    Write a function/method that takes an array and returns a boolean based on whether all items in the array are unique.

    Write a function/method that takes a hash and returns a boolean based on whether all key/value pairs in the hash are unique.

8. Factorial

  * Write a function/method that takes a number n and returns the factorial.

9. Queue
  * Implement a queue data structure that includes functionality like shift, push, and empty?.

10. Stack
  * Implement a stack data structure that includes functionality like pop, push, and empty?.

11. Palindrome
  * Given a string input, determine if the string is a palindrome (spelled the same backwards as forwards, ex. racecar). Do not use any built-in methods/functions.

12. Project Euler
  * [Problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [solutions](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).  

13. Implement sorting algorithms
  * Check some out [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).  

14. Fibonacci
  * Write a method/function that takes a number n and produces an array of Fibonacci numbers, where the length of the array is n.

15. Pig Latin
  * Write a method/function that takes a string and returns the Pig Latin version of that string (including single-word strings, multi-word strings, correctly handling edge cases like queen or quirk, and correctly returning strings with punctuation).

16. Linked List
  * Implement a linked-list data structure that includes functionality like checking for length, finding a specific node by linear search, adding nodes, and deleting nodes.

17. Prime factorization
  * Write a method/function that takes a number and returns the prime factors that make it up. Given 123123123, should return [3, 3, 41, 333667]; given 8, should return [2, 2, 2]; given 6, should return [2, 3]

18. Products of Ints Except At Index
  * You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index. E.g., given [1, 7, 3, 4], return [84, 12, 28, 21]

19. Sum triangle numbers
  * Given a number n, sum up all the right-most numbers from the triangle.

    Example: n = 4

    ```
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10

    => 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20
    ```

20. Binary search
  * Write a method/function that takes an array and a search item, and returns the index of the item if found in the array, or nil otherwise.

21. Binary conversion
  * Write a method/function that takes an integer and returns it in binary notation.

22. Snake case search
  * Write a method/function that takes an array of arrays to represent a board, each of which contain a series of letters; along with a string representing a search term. And returns a boolean based on whether the word is present on the board. Example, given 'hello' and below board, should return true:

    ```
    [
      [a, r, f, d, g, g, h],
      [w, r, f, t, q, e, x],
      [s, c, v, f, g, l, l],
      [r, f, g, q, t, x, o]
    ]
    ```

23. My_Shuffle
  * Write a method/function that takes an array and randomizes the items inside it, without relying on any existing built-in functions/methods.
