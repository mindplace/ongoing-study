<b><u>mindplace/learning:</b></u> <br />
My repo of coding challenges solved in the pursuit of learning Ruby. <br />
<br />
<b>Contents:</b> <br />
=> appAcademy: Problems from appAcademy's [Ruby Basics](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/mini-curriculum/), a great mini-curriculum offered by appAcademy<br /> 
&emsp; to help their applicants dive more deeply into Ruby. Some problems from appAcademy's pre-course prepwork. 
<br />
=> My [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) solutions for easy and medium difficulty levels. Excluded many easy-level problems because they<br /> 
&emsp; were too simple, and excluded hard-level problems because I couldn't afford the premium membership required<br /> 
&emsp; to view them.
<br />
=> FizzBuzz and more: currently just holds [RubyQuiz #126](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz126.html):FizzBuzz, but I think I'm going to be doing more RubyQuiz things and 
adding them here when I have time. 
<br />
=> Greed game! Extra credit from the [Neo Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) course. More info in its [ReadMe](https://github.com/mindplace/learning/tree/master/Greed%20game).
<br />
=> [Neo Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) files for Neo Koans Ruby course. 
<br />
=> Project Euler problems: access the problems [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and solutions [here](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).
<br />
=> Tamagochi pet game: a game I mapped out to build, where the user has a virtual Tamagochi pet which can play with the user and accept
other sorts of interactions, which alter its state. 
<br />
=> [Test First Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) challenges with my solutions.
<br />
=> To do list: one of the first little programs I've written, recently refactored to add a feature where the user can choose to save their
to-do list in a .txt file.
<br /> 
=> Towers of Hanoi: a complete Towers of Hanoi game, playable in the console! And even bug-free! Wow!
<br />
=> [Ruby challenge problems from Viking Code School's Prep Work](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-markup-and-coding/level-up-your-ruby-judo).
