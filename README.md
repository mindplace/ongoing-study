<b><u>mindplace/learning:</b></u> <br />
My repo of coding challenges solved in the pursuit of learning Ruby. <br />
<br />
<b>Contents:</b> <br />
=> appAcademy: Problems from appAcademy's [Ruby Basics](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/mini-curriculum/), a great mini-curriculum offered by appAcademy<br /> 
&emsp; to help their applicants dive more deeply into Ruby. Some problems from appAcademy's pre-course prepwork. 
<br />
=> Battleship! Fully playable console game. User plays against computer, making guesses about where the computer
has placed ships by firing at different locations. 
<br />
=> My [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) solutions for various easy and medium difficulty level problems. 
<br />
=> FizzBuzz and more: currently just holds [RubyQuiz #126](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz126.html):FizzBuzz, but I think I'm going to be doing more RubyQuiz things and 
adding them here when I have time. 
<br />
=> Greed game! Extra credit from the [Neo Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) course. More info in its [ReadMe](https://github.com/mindplace/learning/tree/master/Greed%20game).
Fully playable in the console. 
<br />
=> Hangman game! Fully playable in the console. Was lots of fun to write and test. Doesn't graphically 
show a stick figure being hanged, but it does
let the user choose to be the word guesser or make the computer guess a word the user thinks of. The only issue
is that when the computer is initially booting up its dictionary, it takes it about 2 minutes to parse all the 
words before the game can start. 
<br />
=> [Neo Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) files for Neo Koans Ruby course. 
<br />
=> Mastermind! A fully playable in the console Mastermind game. Computer thinks of a sequence of 
colors, and then the player makes guesses while the computer gives clues by saying how many 
guessed colors are in the exact correct spot and how many are the right colors but in the wrong spots. 
<br />
=> Project Euler problems: access the problems [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and solutions [here](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).
Started writing rspecs for these problems in order to practice my test-making skills. 
<br />
=> Tamagochi pet game: a game I mapped out to build, where the user has a virtual Tamagochi pet which can play with the user and accept
other sorts of interactions, which alter its state. 
<br />
=> [Test First Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) challenges with my solutions.
<br />
=> TicTacToe! Fully playable in the console. Play against the computer. 
<br />
=> To do list: one of the first little programs I've written, recently refactored to add a feature where the user can choose to save their
to-do list in a .txt file.
<br /> 
=> Towers of Hanoi: a complete Towers of Hanoi game, playable in the console! And even bug-free! Wow!
