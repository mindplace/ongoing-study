My repo of coding challenges solved in the pursuit of learning Ruby. <br />
<br />
<b>Contents:</b> <br />
=> appAcademy: Problems from appAcademy's [Ruby Basics](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/mini-curriculum/), a great mini-curriculum offered by appAcademy<br /> 
&emsp; to help their applicants dive more deeply into Ruby.
<br />
=> My [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) solutions for easy and medium difficulty levels. Excluded many easy-level problems because they<br /> 
&emsp; were too simple, and excluded hard-level problems because I couldn't afford the premium membership required<br /> 
&emsp; to view them.
